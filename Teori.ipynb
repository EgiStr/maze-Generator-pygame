    "# Spanning Trees and Prim's & Kruskal's Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A spanning tree is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and forms a tree. Spanning trees are useful in various applications, such as network design, circuit design, and optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prim's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly adds the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree until all vertices are included.\n",
